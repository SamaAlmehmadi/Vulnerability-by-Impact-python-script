# eCPPT Exam Vulnerability Impact Summary

This repository contains a Python script for generating visual summaries of vulnerability severity levels across different network types, specifically tailored for the eCPPT exam. The eCPPT (eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester) certification involves assessing the security posture of various network architectures, and this tool aids in visualizing the impact of vulnerabilities within them.

## Features

- **Customizable Names:** Easily customize network names for clearer visualization.
- **Color-Coded Representation:** Severity levels are color-coded for quick identification.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts for better comprehension.

## Usage

Simply run the script and view the generated visualization to gain insights into vulnerability severity distributions across different network environments.
